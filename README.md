# Playing Cards NFT Collection

Welcome to the Playing Cards NFT Collection, a groundbreaking project that brings the classic card game experience to the Windoge98 on-chain operating system. This unique collection features a complete deck of 54 digital playing cards, each represented as a distinct non-fungible token (NFT) on the blockchain.

## Features

- **NFT Playing Cards**: Each card in the collection is minted as a unique NFT, ensuring its authenticity and ownership. The collection includes all 52 standard playing cards (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades) and two joker cards.
- **Customizable Design**: Owners of the Playing Cards NFTs have the power to personalize their cards by adding custom images (250x250 pixels) to the center of each card. This allows for endless creativity and self-expression.
- **In-Game Integration**: The Playing Cards NFT Collection serves as the primary source of graphics for all card games within the Windoge98 ecosystem. Whether you're playing poker, solitaire, or any other card game, the in-game cards will be fetched directly from this collection.
- **Exclusive Advertising Opportunity**: By customizing their NFT playing cards, owners can effectively turn them into exclusive advertisement billboards. Whenever other players engage in card games on Windoge98, they will be exposed to the unique designs of these personalized cards.
- **Windoge98 Desktop Integration**: The collection is seamlessly integrated with the Windoge98 desktop (desktop.windoge98.com), providing a user-friendly interface for managing, viewing, and editing the NFT playing cards.
- **Built-in Marketplace**: The smart contract behind the Playing Cards NFT Collection acts as a custodian for users who wish to sell their cards. The frontend provides a dedicated marketplace where users can easily list and purchase NFT playing cards.
- **Wallet and Collection Management**: The frontend offers a convenient wallet feature, allowing users to view and manage their owned NFT playing cards. It also provides an overview of all 54 cards in the collection.
- **DIP-721 Compliance**: The Playing Cards NFT Collection adheres to the DIP-721 standard, ensuring compatibility with various wallets and exchanges. While the initial sale will be conducted on the Windoge98 marketplace, the NFTs can be freely transferred to any compatible address or platform.
- **Exclusive to EXE Holders**: To ensure fairness and exclusivity, the initial sale of the Playing Cards NFTs will be limited to EXE token holders. This approach rewards the dedicated members of the Windoge98 community and creates a sense of scarcity and value for the collection.
