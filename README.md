# NFT-Integrated Card Game and Marketplace

## Overview

We are developing an innovative card game platform where users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs representing individual cards from a central deck. This platform will integrate various gaming mechanics and economic incentives to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Key Features

### Central Deck of Cards
- The platform will feature a central deck of 54 unique cards, each represented as an NFT.
- Users can purchase these NFTs, owning the image and metadata of the card. This means that in any game using the central deck, the owned card's graphic and metadata are displayed, giving value to the card owner.

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Free-to-Play:** Initially, all games on the platform will be free to play, allowing users to earn in-game currency (cEXE) through various activities.
- **Daily Spin:** A free daily spin feature will offer different rewards, including cEXE, customizations, and other in-game benefits.

### Economic System
- **cEXE Currency:** This in-game currency can be earned through gameplay and used for various purposes, such as customizing cards.
- **NFT Revenue Sharing:** In games involving betting or other monetary transactions, a portion of the profits will be distributed to the NFT card holders and the winners.
- **Weekly Lottery:** 1% of the profits will go into a pot for a weekly lottery. The threshold to join the lottery is earning cEXE through non-gambling-related games.

### Future Development
- **Poker Integration:** Eventually, users will be able to use EXE tokens in poker games. The platform will initially use chips that can be exchanged, with EXE and simple betting for fun.

This concept is currently in the brainstorming phase, and we are open to feedback and suggestions to refine and enhance the idea further.
